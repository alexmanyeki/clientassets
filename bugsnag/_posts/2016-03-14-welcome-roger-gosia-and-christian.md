Since February, we've added three new team members and we're thrilled to welcome them to our Bugsnag family. We'd like to introduce you to Roger Topp, Gosia Spuray, and Christian Schlensker.

### Roger Topp

Roger joins Bugsnag as our VP of Sales and will be leading our global sales team. From his first job at age 10 as a paper-boy, to being a three time start-up dude (Tangoe/GuideSpark/Zenefits), our team is ready to learn from his experience and perspective.

Roger loves the Chicago Cubs, his Family, golf and coffee…in that order. A big fan of traveling, Roger has scaled 26 peaks on 3 continents, and once road a motorcycle through Italy, Spain, and France! You can learn more about Roger by following him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rogertopp).

### Gosia Spurway

Gosia is our new UK Office Administrator, and the team in Bath couldn't be more excited! Polish born and bred, Gosia went to the UK in 2009 for a short holiday and it quickly became a permanent move. After falling in love with everything English (apart from the weather and driving on the wrong side of the road), she decided to stay, got married to an Englishman, and started drinking tea with milk and biscuits.

Traveling is Gosia's main passion along with food, especially Italian. She even worked for Jamie Oliver for over 4 years. She's already planned her next trip which will take her back to Italy, and as soon as her new passport and visa arrive, she'll be visiting our San Francisco office for the first time.

### Christian Schlensker

And last but not least, we'd like to welcome Christian who is our newest Frontend Engineer. Christian actually went to school to become a graphic designer, but after his first HTML class he was hooked on programming. In the past he's worked as a web designer, iOS developer, Rails developer, and now we're so excited to have him helping us out on our Frontend team.

Outside of work, Christian likes playing games of all types — board games, video games, and mind games. He enjoys overly complicated movie plots, and times when people spontaneously break out into song and/ or dance. Christian's favorite sport to play is disc golf, but his favorite spectator sport is politics. Other hobbies include studying foreign languages and illustrating pixel art.
