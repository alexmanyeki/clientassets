We finally made it to day 12 and once again we're excited to release one of our most frequently requested features, improved error filtering!


## Combine Multiple Filters

![](/img/posts/improved-filtering.gif)
You can now combine multiple filters to the Bugsnag dashboard's error list, allowing you to drill down and find exactly the errors you need. You can now even choose to filter by multiple *release stages* at once, for example Production and Staging.


## First & Last Seen Filters

Trying to find an error that first occurred today? Wan't to filter out all errors which haven't happened in a while? You can now filter your error list by when each error was first or last seen.


## Happy Holidays!

Thanks for all your valuable feedback during the last 2 weeks! As always, please feel free to get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new features. We'll post a recap of all the features next week.
