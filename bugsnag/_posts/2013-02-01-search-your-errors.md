We've just released a feature that we know many of you have been waiting for, you can now search for errors stored in Bugsnag.

From your project dashboard you can search for errors based on where they occurred, the type of error and the error message.

We are planning on adding additional data to our search, so if there is anything in particular you would love to be able to search for, get in touch and we'll see what we can do.

There are a ton more awesome Bugsnag features in the pipeline, keep an eye on
