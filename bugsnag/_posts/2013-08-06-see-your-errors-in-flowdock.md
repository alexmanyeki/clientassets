Today we are pleased to announce that Bugsnag can now notify you of new
exceptions through [Flowdock](http://flowdock.com).  After you enable Flowdock
in your [Bugsnag dashboard](https://www.bugsnag.com) we will automatically add a
new item to the Flow when an error is detected in your application.

Flowdock is already super useful for managing your team's inbox together, and
now that you can see your application errors there too, it's even easier to
prioritise and fix the underlying problems!

To enable the Flowdock integration:

1. Go to *Notifications* from your [Bugsnag dashboard](https://www.bugsnag.com).

2. Select *Post to a Flowdock inbox*.

3. Copy the Flow API token from the [Flowdock tokens page](https://www.flowdock.com/account/tokens)
   to Bugsnag.

Thanks to all the Bugsnag customers who requested this Flowdock integration,
enjoy!
