We’ve revamped email notification settings in a powerful way, with automatic, customizable alerts that come as often as you like. Stay up to date on errors happening in your applications&mdash;just let us know what information you want to receive.

### Per User Email Settings
Each developer on your team can now individually choose which notification emails they wish to receive based on their preferences.

For those who’d like to be alerted to everything happening, set this up without disrupting colleagues who're more interested in seeing a summary of the project.

The power is in your hands&mdash;choose what you’ll receive in your inbox.

### Project Summary Emails
From your user settings page, you can now choose to receive daily or weekly project summary emails that provide an overview of the errors happening in your applications. They’ll show you the errors that occurred in the last day or week, and some basic details, like how many times they were seen.

Also included are top line metrics for your projects, like the number of open and resolved errors, so you can stay up to date on overall debugging progress.

Basically, the summary email is your newest productivity cheat sheet. We’ve taken the time to think through workflow which means you’ll be able to prioritize the most important issues for your team.
