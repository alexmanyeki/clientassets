As the year winds down and the Holiday season is in full swing, we're excited to bring you 12 Features of Christmas â€” one new feature per day in the 12 days leading up to Christmas. We've done this a few times in the past in both [2013](https://blog.bugsnag.com/twelve-features-of-christmas/) and [2014](https://blog.bugsnag.com/12-features-of-christmas-2014/) where we were able to ship features like [viewing source code in your stacktrace](https://blog.bugsnag.com/code-in-stacktrace/), or sending deploy information with your error reports to see which [errors are introduced with each deploy](https://blog.bugsnag.com/deploy-information/).

As anyone who builds software knows, the number of feature requests far outweigh the time to build them. We find 12 Features of Christmas is an effective process to ship features which have been on our radar, but just haven't worked their way into our standard roadmap.

Keep your eye on the [Bugsnag Blog](https://blog.bugsnag.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) over the coming weeks to see all the new things we've built to give you a better experience monitoring production errors with Bugsnag.

To kick things off here's our first feature -

## 12 Features of Christmas: One free month with annual plans

What better way to start things off than launching annual billing options. And to make it even better, we're giving away one month free of Bugsnag to those who opt into an annual plan, so you'll get 12 months of Bugsnag for the price of 11.

We're excited to offer this feature to make access to Bugsnag easier. We've heard frequent requests for annual billing, and now it's available when you select a plan in your [settings](https://app.bugsnag.com/settings).

We'll be working hard to bring you more during the *12 Features of Christmas*. Be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see the remaining 11 features!
