One of the ways we learn at Bugsnag is through our #til Slack channel where our team is constantly posting interesting tips and tricks discovered through our work or scanning the internet. It's a pretty cool feeling to discover new things that are genuinely interesting every day, and we thought we'd share some of those findings with our friends and followers on Twitter. For those of you who haven't kept up with #til on Twitter, here's a roundup of some of our most popular learnings.

## Did you know...

### Reproduce web requests from Chrome by copying them into a curl command

The first #til fact ever was a huge hit! Right click on the web request in the developer console in Chrome and select Copy to cURL. You can then replay it in your terminal to reproduce.

### Readable timestamp in dmesg

When you use dmesg, how annoying is it to see something like this?

`[28503191.683325]`

Try `dmesg -T` for a more readable version of the timestamp.

### Is bundle install slowing you down?

We've all been there, annoyed when bundle installing takes forever. But did you know that you can speed things up by installing gems in parallel? With some help from [thoughtbot's guide](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/parallel-gem-installing-using-bundler), try parallel installation to avoid waiting around.

`bundle config --global JOBS '3'`

### A helpful tool for canned responses in GitHub

Do you ever find yourself typing the same thing over and over in GitHub? Here's a useful [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-canned-responses/lhehmppafakahahobaibfcomknkhoina) that'll save you loads of time â€” you can setup canned responses that'll appear in a dropdown menu in the comment view.

### Avoid deleting files forever by mistake

Running `rm` by mistake can be a huge pain when you accidentally delete things permanently. To avoid mistakes, alias `rm` to move files to trash instead. Check out  [http://hasseg.org/trash/](http://hasseg.org/trash/) for OS X and [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli) for Linux.
