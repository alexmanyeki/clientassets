Today we're excited to announce [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly/) integration for Bugsnag! If you enable Sprint.ly in your Bugsnag dashboard, we can automatically create Sprint.ly defects when errors are detected in your applications.

Sprint.ly is a great way to manage your projects and other tasks, so we've made it
super easy for your app's errors to be part of your existing workflows.

Connecting Bugsnag and Sprint.ly is easy:

-   Go to Notifications from your [Bugsnag dashboard](https://www.bugsnag.com)
-   Select Sprint.ly
-   Enter your [Sprint.ly API credentials](https://support.sprint.ly/hc/en-us/articles/213641747-Getting-your-API-Key)

Thanks to all the Bugsnag customers who requested this integration, and to [Kenny Meyer](https://github.com/kennym) and [Justin Abrahms](https://github.com/justinabrahms) for helping build it, enjoy!
