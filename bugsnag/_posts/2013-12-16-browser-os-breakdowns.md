We're now one week into our *Twelve Features of Christmas* (phew!) and we're continuing our quest to highlight the most common trends and patterns in your errors.

As of *right now* you'll see browser and operating system breakdown charts for your JavaScript errors, directly on the error details pages of your Bugsnag dashboard. We've even back-populated these using existing data, so you won't need to update your Bugsnag notifier code!

## Browser breakdown

Having a breakdown of affected browsers helps you immediately see if each error was limited to a particular browser, or class of browsers. You can now see at a glance if an error is only occurring on Internet Explorer.


## OS breakdown

It is often the case that an error will be limited to a single operating system, we'll also show you an at-a-glance breakdown of which OS each error occurred on.


## We'd Love Your Feedback

Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new feature. We'd love to hear your feedback! Stay posted via our blog or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see what we release tomorrow!
