We're on a mission to help you efficiently detect and eliminate errors in your JavaScript apps, and to that end, we're excited to announce that we've acquired the technology and IP from JavaScript monitoring app [Rescue.js](http://rescuejs.com)!

Rescue.js first rose to prominence as one of the winners of the 2012 [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/) competition. Built by [Conrad Irwin](https://twitter.com/conradirwin), and [Lee Mallabone](https://twitter.com/LeeMallabone) it attracted interest from thousands of software developers overnight.

According to a [study last month](http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2014/01/22/language-rankings-1-14/) by RedMonk, JavaScript is now the most popular programming language among developers. The increasing popularity of JavaScript frameworks like Backbone, Ember and Angular means that most sites now have significant business logic in JavaScript, and undetected bugs can lead to customers being unable to complete vital transactions.

The Rescue.js IP has already been used to significantly improve our [JavaScript error monitoring](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript/), weâ€™re now confident in calling it the best on the market. Bugsnag is now detecting millions of JavaScript crashes per day.

Check out our improved [JavaScript error monitoring](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-js) and let us know what you think!
