We've just released a hotly-requested feature, dashboard timezone selection! You can now choose between your local timezone and UTC from your user profile page:

[![Timezone selection](/img/posts/change-timezone.png)](/img/posts/change-timezone.png)

All timestamps and charts in your Bugsnag dashboard will now be displayed according to your preference:

![Chart timezone](/img/posts/charts-timezone.png)

In many cases you'll also be able to see the secondary timezone on hover!

Let us know what you think about this new feature via [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) or [email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com), we'd love to hear your feedback!
