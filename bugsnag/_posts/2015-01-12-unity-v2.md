I'm happy to announce the second release of [Bugsnag
Unity](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/unity/). Unity was one of the earliest
platforms supported by Bugsnag and we've learned a lot along the way.

This new
notifier bundles the latest copy of [Bugsnag
Cocoa](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ios/) and [Bugsnag
Android](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/android/) which brings a whole host of new features:

1. Symbolication on iOS devices.
2. Support for Severity indicators so you can distinguish crashes from expected error cases.
3. Better grouping of exceptions across platforms.

All of this, and more, while maintaining a small footprint, and a simple API. We've also fixed
a few problems with the old notifier, in particular you no longer need to edit the XCode project
in order for Bugsnag to work.

To install the plugin, [download it from Github](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-unity/) and
drag it into your Unity project. Any exceptions that happen on iPhone or Android will be
reported to your Bugsnag dashboard so that you can debug any problems your users are seeing.
