Release stage indicators have now been added as a column on the Inbox page, helping you more quickly scan for the environment in which specific errors have occurred.

If an error has occurred in multiple release stages, simply hover over the `+` icon for a list of all the environments where that error has been seen.

See something that needs a closer look? You can still use the key/value filter bar to sort your error data down to a specific release stage for deeper investigation into a crash. For more on the filter bar, see [our documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/filtering-dashboard/).
