The year’s coming to an end, but our team at Bugsnag’s just gearing up! Get ready because we’re bringing you the *12 Features of Christmas*—12 new features in the next 12 days.

You may remember the *12 Features of Christmas* from last year, and this year’s sure to bring the same holiday cheer, and the features you want! We’re hard at work building the things you’ve most frequently requested this year so you can get the most out of Bugsnag.

Over the next 12 days, we’ll announce a new feature on our blog, and on Twitter. Our team loves hearing from you, so please don’t hesitate to reach out to us with any feedback or comments.

So to kick things off, here’s feature number 1 of the *12 Features of Christmas*:

## View code in your stacktrace

We’re excited to announce that you can now view your project’s code in your stacktrace. This will make viewing error information better than ever. You can still navigate to view it on Github, but within Bugsnag it’ll be easier to make sense of what’s happening in your code.

Right now we’ve introduced support for this in Ruby, JavaScript, and Python, and we’ll be expanding it to our other notifiers in the future. To start viewing code in your stacktrace, please update your [notifier library](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/).

We hope these features will make debugging easier than ever, so you can painlessly fix broken code and move on.

Stay tuned during our *12 Features of Christmas* sprint as we announce exciting new stuff coming out of the Bugsnag office.

Happy Holidays!
