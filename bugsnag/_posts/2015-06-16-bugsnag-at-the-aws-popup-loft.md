Have you ever wondered how Bugsnag's backend handles billions of crashes from so many applications? Well now you can find out! Our very own [Keegan Lowenstein](https://twitter.com/keeganlow) will be speaking at the [AWS PopUp Loft](http://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/sf-loft/) in San Francisco this Thursday, June 18th at 6pm. You can find all the details [here](http://aws.amazon.com/start-ups/loft/sf-loft/) and RSVP for the event. We're excited so we hope you'll come say hello!

Here's what you'll learn about:

>"At Bugsnag, we receive error reports from our customers when their mobile, server, or JavaScript applications crash. This means that we sometimes experience large fluctuations in load as customers release bad code and then subsequently release a fix. This unpredictability led Bugsnag to develop responsive infrastructure to keep costs down, while also responding to customer demand in real time. In this talk we'll go over how we've architected our applications to make the best use of Autoscaling and AWS to deliver the best service to our customers. We'll cover deploying your application to responsive infrastructure, and talk about techniques you can use to reduce response time so your customers remain unaware that your traffic has increased."

We're also [hiring](https://www.bugsnag.com/jobs/) right now, so come out and say hello to some of the Bugsnag team!
