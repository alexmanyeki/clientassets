We wanted a pricing plan that was fair and transparent, so rather than having
a complex bracketed pricing plan, we’ve set it up so that you'll pay only
for what you use. We've also created a free plan, so that smaller developers
can enjoy Bugsnag.

New Plans
---------

### Full Plan
$29/month, includes 25,000 exceptions, 25¢ per 1,000 additional
exceptions. This plan includes all of our premium features, unlimited users
and unlimited projects.

### Free Plan
Includes 2,000 exceptions/month, one user and unlimited
projects. Premium features such as chatroom notification, ticket creation,
error resolving and deploy tracking are not included.

More detailed information on our plans is available on our
[pricing page](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/).
