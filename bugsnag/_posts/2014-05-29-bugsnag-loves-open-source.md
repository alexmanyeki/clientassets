We at Bugsnag love open source. Supporting the open source community is important, so we are offering **free Bugsnag** to all open source projects!

![Open source projects using Bugsnag](/img/posts/open-source.jpg)

GitHub's [Atom Editor](https://www.atom.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), [Laravel.com](http://Laravel.com), and [Showterm.io](http://Showterm.io) are some of the awesome open source projects already using Bugsnag, you should too!

[Shoot an email to us](mailto:opensource@bugsnag.com) and link us to your repository to get your account set up. If you're so inclined, you can tell us a little bit about your open source project, and we'll tweet about it!
