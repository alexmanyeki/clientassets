We've been so heads down on some new product features recently that we forgot to let you know about the new humans that joined the Bugsnag team: Chris Kotars and Kelly Shearon.

Kelly is our new VP of Marketing. She has spent her career hacking marketing for a number of products and companies, including GitHub, making it as authentic, empathetic, and original as possible. In her spare time she writes CoffeeScript to relax.

Chris is our new Strategic Sales Manager. He's a creative, consultative problem solver, who loves helping customers improve their products.
