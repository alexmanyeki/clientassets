Today, by popular demand, we are pleased to announce
[Asana](http://asana.com/) integration for Bugsnag! If you enable Asana in
your Bugsnag dashboard, we can automatically create Asana tasks when an error
is detected in your applications.

Asana is a great way to manage your projects and other tasks, so we've made it
super easy for your app's errors to be part of your existing workflows.

Thanks to all the Bugsnag customers who requested this Asana integration,
enjoy!
