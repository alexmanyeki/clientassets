Today is day four of our *Twelve Features of Christmas* sprint, and we're rolling out a feature which should make interacting with your Bugsnag dashboard much quicker. Say hello to keyboard shortcuts!

You can now take advantage of more efficent navigation, access common actions such as *resolving errors*, *creating issues* and *adding comments* without touching your mouse!

We have also provided some additional Vim-friendly aliases, if you are used to using those on other applications.

You can open the list of keyboard shortcuts at any time by pressing `?` on your keyboard, or by clicking *shortcuts* in the footer of the dashboard.

## We'd Love Your Feedback

Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new feature. We'd love to hear your feedback! Stay posted via our blog or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see what we release tomorrow!
