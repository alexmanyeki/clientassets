We've shipped a new time-saving feature to your [dashboard](https://app.bugsnag.com/user/sign_in) to make Bugsnag more powerful for you and your team. You can now see an *Issue Created Tooltip* when you hover over errors that have issues created against them.

The tooltip links to the relevant issue in your issue tracker, helping you to save time as you move between tools.
