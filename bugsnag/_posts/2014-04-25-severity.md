We're launching our *severity* feature today to help you triage your crashes and focus on what's most important to your team.

This new feature allows you to tag your errors as either an *error*, *warning* or *info* when notifying Bugsnag about exceptions. Simply [update your Bugsnag notifier library](#update-your-bugsnag-library) to start using severity in your apps!


### Handled vs Unhandled Errors

We'll automatically tag your unhandled/fatal exceptions as the *error* severity. Handled exceptions will default to the *warning* severity, and you can override this when calling `Bugsnag.notify` from your code.

You can immediately see the severity of each error on your Bugsnag dashboard:

### Severity Filtering

You can also filter your error list by severity, to help you narrow down your errors:

### Update Your Bugsnag Library

We've rolled out support for the severity feature on all of our official notifiers, and where possible we've back-populated existing data. We recommend you update your notifier to start using the severity feature. Check out the documentation for the [Ruby](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ruby/), [PHP](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/php/), [JavaScript](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/browsers/), [Android](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/android/), [Cocoa](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ios/), [Node.js](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/nodejs/), [Python](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/python/) and [Java](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/java/) notifiers for details on how to set custom severities in your application.
