We're excited to introduce the newest members of the Bugsnag team.

## Micaela Ballew

Micaela joins the Bugsnag design team and will be practicing her love for branding and building design systems. In the past, she worked at an experience design agency, trying her hand at everything from interactive design, identity, and branding, to web design, print, interiors, and more!

Micaela is a California native who grew up in St. Helena in wine country and has been naturally inclined towards design her entire life, even practicing graphic design (though she didn't know what it was) since she was 12 or 13 years old. Nowadays, she spends her time traveling to beautiful places like Sea Ranch or Big Sur and loves venturing to fancy cocktail bars and drinking lots of coffee.

## Simon Bowring

Simon joins the Bugsnag engineering team in Bath, but in past lives, he's worked as a bicycle mechanic, bartender, and also as a software engineer in Slovakia.

Simon is originally from Cornwall, by the sea, and now lives in Bath, but spent a bunch of time in the US last summer visiting the national parks like Yosemite and Zion. In his spare time, he's quite active and enjoys cycling, squash, and playing pool, but you can also find him playing video games or brewing beer. He recently had a baby girl, too! Congrats, Simon!

## Corin Aguilar

Corin is Bugsnag's first ever full-time recruiter, and we're very excited to have her.

Corin is very competitive, especially when it comes to monopoly, and she loves things that are tart, like Pisco Sours and Almanac sour beers. One of Corin's favorite places to travel to is her sister's 12 acre flower farm in New London, PA, where she tries to visit 3 times a year.

## Karissa Peth

Karissa is the newest member of the Bugsnag marketing team and will be helping lead our team's events and community efforts.

Karissa studied molecular biology and worked in cancer research for 9 years before making the move to technology, but has embraced it fully, even working on interactive projects like an Amazon Echo skill. In her spare time, you can find her sewing clothing or making pasta from scratch.
