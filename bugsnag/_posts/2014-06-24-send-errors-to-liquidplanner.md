Today we're excited to announce [LiquidPlanner](http://www.liquidplanner.com/) integration for Bugsnag! If you enable LiquidPlanner in your Bugsnag dashboard, we can automatically create LiquidPlanner tasks when errors are detected in your applications.

LiquidPlanner is a great way to manage your teams and projects, so we've made it
super easy for your application's errors to be part of your existing workflows.

Connecting Bugsnag and LiquidPlanner is easy:

-   Go to Notifications from your [Bugsnag dashboard](https://www.bugsnag.com)
-   Select LiquidPlanner
-   Enter your LiquidPlanner Workspace ID, Email and Password

Thanks to all the Bugsnag customers who requested this integration, and especially to [Megan Kiest-McFarland](https://github.com/mkiestmcfarland) from LiquidPlanner for contributing the plugin. Enjoy!
