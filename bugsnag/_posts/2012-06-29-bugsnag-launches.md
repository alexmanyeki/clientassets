Today we are excited to announce the Beta of [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com)!
Bugsnag captures errors in real-time from your web, mobile and desktop
applications, helping you to understand and resolve them as fast as possible.


Get notified about all errors, even in production
-------------------------------------------------

As an app developer, one of your most important tasks is making sure your
users have a good experience when using your product. Tracking errors and
exceptions that occur in your application will help you to eliminate crashes
and other bad experiences, ensuring your users can focus on enjoying your app.

Bugsnag's error notifier libraries run safely and silently in your app,
even in production, meaning you will be notified whenever a user encounters an
error or crash.


Open source plugin architecture
-------------------------------

We have developed [open-source libraries](http://github.com/bugsnag) for most
common languages and frameworks that you can include in your applications to
automatically capture and report any errors or exceptions, meaning you’ll
know when every single error happens in production.

Bugsnag can notify you by email when an error occurs, send a notification into
your chat room or even automatically create a ticket using our
[open-source notification plugins](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-notification-plugins#readme).
If we don’t support your chat room or ticketing system, you can even build
your own plugin!


Intelligent grouping, at a glance indicators
------------------------------
Capturing errors and exceptions is only one part of the story. Bugsnag
intelligently groups similar errors together, shows how many users are affected
by each error and highlights errors which are new or have unusual spikes in
occurrences. Using bugsnag, you can easily focus on finding and fixing the most
urgent errors first.


More features, frameworks coming very soon
------------------------------------------

This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for wider support for your favorite
languages and frameworks, and features to help you identify and fix errors
quickly. [Get in touch](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) if you have any ideas
or suggestions on how we can improve bugsnag, we’d love to hear from you.
