We'd like to welcome Nicole Broadstock to the Bugsnag team as our Office Manager! Nicole has been an office manager for 12 years at various startups. We're really excited to have her because she'll be helping our team in so many ways. To get started she'll be onboarding our newest team members, and helping us keep the Bugsnag office and culture as goofy and productive as ever.
