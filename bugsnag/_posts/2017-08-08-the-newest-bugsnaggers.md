We've been heads down in 2017 working hard to continue building and improving Bugsnag for you and your team. We've grown a lot this year and we wanted to introduce you to our new Bugsnag team members in San Francisco, CA and Bath, England.

### George Shaheen

George leads the Bugsnag Customer Success team in San Francisco and is responsible for leading all aspects of our customer facing technical account management and support engineering teams. He has more than 15 years experience in software and SaaS sales and services, having most recently joined us from New Relic. In his spare time you'll find him hiking, running, eating delicious food, discovering new whiskey or wine, or hunting for the next best cold brew.

### Sachin Pande

We're excited to introduce Sachin Pande from our engineering team in Bath where he's working on making Bugsnag on-prem work better for our enterprise customers. Sachin enjoys playing and watching sports, like cricket, soccer, badminton, and American football. He's also into gaming, reading, and gadgets. Recently, he's made his house smarter with his Amazon Alexa and Lights, and even bought a 3D printer to start making 3D models and print them!

### Izzy Mathias

Also in our Bath office is Izzy Mathias, who has joined our operations team as office administrator in the UK! Izzy is into music, sci-fi, dark comedy, comic books, and has a side business with one of her best friends selling hand-crafted goods from Morocco. Izzy likes to DJ as a hobby and has a goal to start writing a sci-fi novel this year.

### Madi Phillips

Madi is our Growth intern for the summer, and is a rising junior at SMU, studying marketing and statistics.

She's a southern California native and some of her favorite things include photography, keeping up with fashion trends, and petting every dog she sees. Before heading back to school in Dallas, she is going to spend three months studying abroad in London and traveling across Europe.

### Roger Guldbrandsen

Roger is one of our new software engineers in Bath. He has lived in the US, Norway, Japan, and the UK. He's interested in most things related to technology and programming, and is the co-organiser of a machine learning meetup group. In his spare time, he likes doing karate, or tinkering with his own programming projects.

### Shaina Vu

Shaina Vu has joined our customer success team in San Francisco, and we're so happy to have her! Shaina got her start in Customer Success at PagerDuty, where she worked with some of their biggest clients while simultaneously building out the Success team and their processes. She is known for being outspoken and energetic, occasionally to a fault, and is currently campaigning for the important title of Bugsnag Lunch Deputy.

### Jamie Lynch

Jamie Lynch has also joined our engineering team in Bath and is working on mobile platforms. Jamie studied Biochemistry at University of Bath and has spent the last three years developing native Android and iOS apps for a digital agency. He's also maintained the popular open source library Android Bootstrap for the last couple years. On the weekends, he's a fan of hiking and recently completed a 13 mile hike halfway across the Isle of Wight!

### Renee Balmert

Renee has joined our customer success team as a recent grad from [Hackbright Academy](https://hackbrightacademy.com/). Previously, she worked in private equity as an Office Manager and CRM guru. While she loves visiting the Mediterranean and eating pretty much anywhere, Renee spends most of her free time geeking out with comics, animation and film, and is a longtime volunteer at SF's Cartoon Art Museum.

### Jim Ettig

And last but not least, we're happy to welcome Jim Ettig. Jim grew up in the mitten state (aka Michigan) and is Bugsnag's Chief Revenue Officer. Most weekends you can find him hiking the Sonoma Coast or at a winery with his English Cream Golden Retriever, Gus. When not sipping wine in wine country, thereâ€™s a great chance you may run into him at one of the many Bay Area music venues or a farmers market.
