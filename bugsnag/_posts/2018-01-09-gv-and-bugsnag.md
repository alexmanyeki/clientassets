When we started Bugsnag almost five years ago, we set out to build a tool that would help product teams deal with production errors and improve the quality of their software. Since then, we’ve delivered that value to over 4,100 world class development teams on our paid products and even more on our free and open source plans.

### The Releases dashboard

Today we are making it even easier to confidently progress from development to production and get immediate, tangible feedback on the quality of each release. We have built a new dashboard, called the Releases dashboard, which combines information about all errors seen and introduced in each release of your app and a crash rate indicator that gives you an easy-to-understand and definitive metric for application release quality.

There will be a special, live webinar on January 16th at 10AM PST with Duncan Hewett, our VP of Product Development, and Karissa Peth from Developer Relations to demo the Releases dashboard and take your questions. [Sign up here](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5189136719084921858?source=Social). You can read more about our Releases dashboard in our [blog](https://blog.bugsnag.com/release-health-and-visibility/) and in our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/releases/).

### GV and Bugsnag

We also want to let you know that GV, formerly Google Ventures, has led a financing round in Bugsnag based on the strength of our roadmap, including the Releases dashboard. You can read more about that in our [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/01/prweb15058947.htm). We are excited to have GV join us on our mission.

The Releases dashboard is available today in all standard [Bugsnag Pro plans](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/). Please check it out! Organizations on our standard Free and Team plans and legacy customers can start a 14-day trial of Releases by clicking on the new Releases tab. Customers with custom and on-premise plans can contact support@bugsnag.com for more information.
