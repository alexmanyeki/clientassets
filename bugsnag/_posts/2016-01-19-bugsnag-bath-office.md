We're starting off the new year by opening a new office in [Bath, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset). This city has a special place in Bugsnag history, as both our founders met and graduated from the University of Bath. Bath's technology and startup scene is growing fast, and we're incredibly excited to be part of the community.

Our new UK team of five talented backend developers will be working out of our Bath office. We're pleased to introduce you to:

#### Duncan Hewett

Duncan is a huge [cricket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket) fan. He spends most of the summer playing cricket and most of the winter waiting for the summer cricket season to start.

#### William Starling

William enjoys classical choral singing and has even taken part in some light operas. He's also really into [entomophagy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy), the pretty terrifying practice of eating insects.

#### Mike Bull

Originally from Wales, Mike likes playing board games and doing cryptic crossword puzzles in his spare time. He also likes to play [racquet sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Racquet_sports).

#### Ben Ibinson

Since he comes from a family of hospital professionals, Ben thought it made sense to be a Doctor, too, but since he can't stand the sight of blood, a PhD in [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) made more sense than one in Medicine. In his spare time he likes playing American pool and [snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker), and spending time with his wife and daughter in [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol).

#### Dave Perryman

Dave keeps busy working, staying active, or spending time with his ten-month old daughter. He's participated in over ten half marathons, loves playing tennis at the tennis court next door, and his preferred way of getting to work is cycling.
