Happy Day 5 of the *12 Features of Christmas*! Today, you can start filtering your [search results](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/filtering-dashboard/) in Bugsnag, making it easier than ever to drill into your errors.

One of the things that makes Bugsnag so awesome is our commitment to bringing you *answers*, not just information. Our powerful prioritization and triage tools make it easy to figure out what’s happening with your data, so you’re not overloaded with error details.

Now you can combine these robust tools with your search results. Search for a specific error class or user ID, and then filter those results by stage, severity, deploy, and more. You can drill even deeper into your error information, giving you the answers you need to gain insight into what’s happening in your application.
