It's been a while since we last updated you on the newest members of the Bugsnag team. Please meet Tim Crotty, Jeff Dalli, and Josh Wold! They're the newest members of the Sales and Marketing teams.

## Tim Crotty

Tim is a killer new Account Executive on the Sales team, and we're so happy to have him.

Originally from Orange County, Tim graduated from USC with a degree in Accounting, but found his calling in sales. On the weekends you can find him hiking in Edgewood Park, hanging out at a whiskey bar with his friends, or hitting the gym.

## Jeff Dalli

We've added a new intern to the Sales team — Jeff Dalli! Jeff just finished his freshman year at Stanford, and is now helping out here at Bugsnag as our Sales Ops intern.

Jeff is a two-time national fencing champion and has been ranked in the top 16 in the world. He's been fencing for ten years now, and even founded the Bay Area Fencing Initiative,  a nonprofit that brings the sport of fencing to underprivileged youth throughout the Bay Area.

## Josh Wold

And last but not least is our new VP of Marketing — Josh Wold. Josh was a member of the early team at Atlassian and helped build much of their go-to-market strategy. Since then he's been leading marketing at startups.

Before joining Bugsnag, Josh went on a road trip to many of the national parks in the US and Canada. He loves to travel and has visited over 25 countries and even lived in four so far. He loves spending time with this family, and is learning Spanish with his kids as they grow up.
