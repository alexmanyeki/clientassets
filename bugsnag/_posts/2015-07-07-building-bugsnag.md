Today we're excited to announce our partnership with [Benchmark](http://www.benchmark.com/), and welcome Eric Vishria to our board.

Since we raised our initial [seed funding in 2013](/bugsnag-is-growing), we've caught more than 250 million errors a day for companies like Slack, GitHub, Square, Shopify, and VMware.  We also built [Bugsnag Enterprise](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/), the on-premise version of Bugsnag.com, and added tons of new features like [code in your stacktrace](/code-in-stacktrace), [average device states for mobile errors](/average-device-state), [project error trend graphs](/project-trends), [mobile breadcrumb logging](/introducing-mobile-breadcrumbs), [sourcemap support for Javascript error monitoring](/sourcemaps-info), [more intelligent error alerts](/project-spiking-alerts), and a number of [workflow improvements](/workflow-improvements) for triaging and handling errors.

We're incredibly proud of our progress and the team here that's made it all possible. At the same time, we're also ready to do much, much more.

## Why Benchmark

Benchmark has a history of investing in some of [the top SaaS and Enterprise companies around](https://twitter.com/benchmark/lists/current-venture-portfolio/members) like Dropbox, Zendesk, Docker, and Yelp. Their team also has an outstanding track record of running lean and focusing on what matters most - accelerating the growth of their portfolio companies. As we develop more ways to help companies of all sizes deliver and maintain production-quality applications, we're excited to collaborate with the entire Benchmark team and to have their expertise on hand.

We also look forward to continuing to work with Dana Stalder and the the team at [Matrix](http://www.matrixpartners.com/), who led our seed round and remain as committed partners.

## What's next

Errors in production affect every industry. Crashes lead to abandoned purchases, bad reviews, and customer churn, and development teams today are wasting over $300 billion a year to fix errors that weren't caught by their testing suites.

We know first hand that engineering teams need better tools and a streamlined workflow to fix production errors before they negatively impact users. That's why we built Bugsnag, and that's where we plan to focus all our efforts in the next few years. We want to make it easier for development teams to surface their most critical errors, and we want companies to be able to understand the impact of crashes on their business.

Some of the best engineers, product designers, marketers, and salespeople around work at Bugsnag already, and we're looking for more talented humans to join our team. Check out our [jobs page](https://www.bugsnag.com/jobs/) for a list of current openings, or shoot us an email at jobs@bugsnag.com if you're interested in joining our team.
