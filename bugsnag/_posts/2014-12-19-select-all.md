For day 8 of the *12 Features of Christmas* we're bringing you an extra helpful, time saving trick: select all errors matching your filters.

When you click *Select All*, we automatically select the errors on the page you're viewing. But now, you’ll also see a banner appear, asking if you’d like to select all the errors you've filtered to, including those on the following pages. Easily banish the banner away, or accept the offer to save yourself some time paging through.

This time saving tool will make your Bugsnag experience just that much better, so you can easily manage your errors.
