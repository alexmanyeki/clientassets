Today we're happy to announce that Bugsnag has raised $1.4 million in seed funding from [Matrix Partners](http://www.matrixpartners.com) and some great angel investors. You can check out the full details on our [press release](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/9/prweb11143908.htm) or the [TechCrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/20/bugsnag-the-error-reporting-platform-used-by-linkedin-and-others-raises-1-2m-seed-round/), but we also want to talk about how this is great news for you, our customers!


Better Bugsnag for Everyone
---------------------------

The #1 reason we decided to raise money is to make Bugsnag better for everyone. We have an exciting roadmap of product improvements ahead, but we need to grow our engineering team to make that happen. Expect improvements to the Bugsnag dashboards, broader platform support and better mobile monitoring in the next few months.


Bugsnag is Hiring
-----------------

We're looking for talented software engineers and designers and to join the Bugsnag team! If you are interested in product design, data visualization, working with many varied programming languages, or just building great products for fellow developers, send us an email at <jobs@bugsnag.com>!


Thanks For Your Support!

We couldn't have got this far without our amazing customers, thanks for supporting Bugsnag and look forward to more awesomeness in the future!
