You can now integrate Bugsnag with [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) and see errors from your mobile, browser, and backend applications in real-time in your Splunk analytics and monitoring set-up. Bugsnag supports over [50 platforms and frameworks](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms/) so you can send error data detected by Bugsnag from across your technology stack.

When you integrate Bugsnag with Splunk, Bugsnag will send stacktraces, affected user details, device/environment information, and custom metadata with any errors as they happen to your Splunk configuration. Integrating Splunk with Bugsnag is simple and you can [learn more about getting setup in our documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/integrations/splunk/).

## Why integrate Bugsnag with Splunk?

For organizations using Splunk for application monitoring, sending Bugsnag errors will enrich their data with information about problematic code in their applications, and the additional details needed to understand problems and how to fix them. Information about users affected and the custom metadata you can add to errors can also help teams figure out how to prioritize bug fixes.

Adding Bugsnag errors to your business analytics reports in Splunk can also be helpful. By sending error data, you can show the impact software bugs can have on your business metrics, like conversion and even revenue. Taking this into account can help your team continually invest in maintaining a high-level of software quality by keeping ahead of application errors.   

#### Add error insights to your Splunk dashboards  

Another way to use your Bugsnag data with your Splunk data is to add it to your Splunk dashboards. That way, you can make your application errors visible throughout your organization and include them in your business reports.
