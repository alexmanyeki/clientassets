The Bugsnag team will be out and about at a bunch of conferences this year. Here’s a roundup of where we’ll be this spring. We hope to see you there!

## Forward 4 Web Summit

We're going to be attending the [Forward 4 Web Summit](http://forwardjs.com) in San Francisco, California on February 10th at the Regency Ballroom. The Forward 4 Web Summit is a one-day event focusing on JavaScript and web technologies. We’ll be sponsoring, so stop by our table to pick up our new Bugsnag JavaScript lapel pins.

You can also see [James Smith](https://twitter.com/loopj), Bugsnag CEO and Co-founder, speak at 2:10pm in Track 4. He'll talk about *Best Practices for Building Popular Open-Source JavaScript Libraries*.

> Building the same components from scratch for your JavaScript projects just doesn’t make sense. This is why libraries are really powerful — you can use them to more easily build your creative projects, saving tons of time. And if you build something cool yourself, why not share it with the world? We’ll look at what it takes to successfully share your code with the world, learning from examples like [jQuery Tokeninput](http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/), a project that’s been downloaded millions of times.

We’re really excited to sponsor the first [DroidCon](http://sf.droidcon.com/) happening in San Francisco on March 17th and 18th. DroidCon is a community driven Android conference, and this year’s first event will take place at the Fort Mason Center. We'll be at our booth giving out our latest Android lapel pins, and you'll also be able to catch James giving a talk about Android libraries.

In case you [hadn’t heard yet](https://blog.bugsnag.com/bugsnag-bath-office/), we just opened our second office in Bath, England, so we’ll be a lot more involved in the Bath Ruby community. To kick things off, we’ll be sponsoring the [Bath Ruby](http://2016.bathruby.uk/) conference on March 11th, which will be held at The Assembly Rooms. You’ll even be able to find some of our new UK team members there, so be on the lookout for those Bugsnag t-shirts.
