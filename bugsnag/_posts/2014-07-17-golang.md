At Bugsnag, we've been rewriting some of our high-throughput services in
[Golang](https://golang.org). The only problem? There was no official Bugsnag
support.

That changes today! I've written a [Bugsnag notifier for
Golang](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-go) and added it as an officially
supported language to the website.

It's designed for easy use with HTTP servers, but can automatically catch
unhandled panics in all Golang apps. We also have built-in support for both
[Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com) and the
[revel](https://revel.github.io/) framework.

We've been using the notifier in production for a while now for our performance
critical API end-point. It's completely stable and avoids adding any latency to
requests by using a goroutine to send notifications to Bugsnag.

As usual, open source projects can use [Bugsnag for
free](/bugsnag-loves-open-source), and we'd love to see
what people are up to in Golang.

P.S. Bugsnag has unofficially supported Golang for a while. Thanks to
[everyone](https://github.com/toggl/bugsnag/network) who contributed!
