It’s getting close to the end of the 12 Features of Christmas, but we’re bringing you something really great for day 11. Today you can undo actions in your dashboard.

Let’s say you’ve been working hard during a bug smashing day, of course with Bugsnag helping you and your team through it. But it’s been a long day and, oops! You mistakenly delete all your errors! Never fear—we have your back. This new feature allows you to undo any actions you take in your dashboard.

You can also undo accidental resolves, archives and assigns - so those mistakes will no longer be quite so annoying!

Do you have any feedback for us? Let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag)!
