We've just launched [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/home) integration for Bugsnag! If you enable Assembla in your Bugsnag dashboard, we can automatically create Assembla tickets when errors are detected in your applications.

Assembla is an awesome way to manage your projects and collaborate around code, so we've made it
super easy for your app's errors to be part of your existing workflows.

Connecting Bugsnag and Assembla is easy:

-   Go to Notifications from your [Bugsnag dashboard](https://app.bugsnag.com/user/sign_in)
-   Select Assembla
-   Enter your [Assembla API credentials](https://www.assembla.com/login)

Thanks to [Fran√ßois-Pierre Bouchard](https://github.com/fpbouchard) for building this notification plugin! We're always happy to merge new notification plugins, check out our [Notification Plugin Creation Guide](https://docs.bugsnag.com) for details of our open-source plugin architecture.
