Our team is excited to announce that Bugsnag now supports two-factor authentication. We know how important the integrity of your data is, so we’ve added in extra security to keep your error information safe. This means that even if a malicious person gains access to your password, they won’t be able to login to Bugsnag as you.

We’re offering application based, two-factor authentication that you can use with a tool like [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) or [Authy](https://www.authy.com/).

We highly recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your entire team. It's easy to setup! Go to your [user settings page](https://app.bugsnag.com/settings) and click *Enable* under Two-Factor Authentication. Then scan a QR code, and enter in your two-factor authentication token. You'll be prompted for your token whenever you log in.
