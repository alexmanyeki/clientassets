Rickie Sherman has joined the Bugsnag team as a Designer, and we couldn't be more excited to have him! He'll be helping us make everything—from our main product to our website and more—awesome to look at and use.

As a kid, Rickie wanted to be a botanist when he grew up, but he put that dream aside when he discovered his love for design through hacking Windows to customize the UI. Now he spends his days pushing pixels instead of potting plants. For more on Rickie, follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rickie).
