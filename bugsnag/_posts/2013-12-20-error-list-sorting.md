Today is the penultimate day of our *Twelve Features of Christmas*, and today we're excited to announce that you can now sort the list of errors within the dashboard!

![](/img/posts/sorting.gif)

You can sort your errors by,

- *First Seen* - When an error first occurred
- *Last Seen* - When an error last occurred
- *Occurrences* - How many times an error occurred
- *Users Impacted* - How many users have seen this error

This means that you can easily see which errors are new by sorting by first seen, or prioritize those bugs which have impacted the most users!
