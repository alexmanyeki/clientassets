On their own, [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) and [vim](http://www.vim.org/) are both great tools; together, they're even better.

Recently, I wrote about a few [benefits of using
tmux](https://blog.bugsnag.com/benefits-of-using-tmux/). The benefits I
discussed there are independent of one's choice of text editor. But if you're a
vim user, the benefits of tmux reach even further. One of my favorite aspects
of tmux is that it unlocks the potential for a more powerful vim-based
development environment, allowing vim and the shell to feel more like a single
cohesive tool.

In this post we'll look at a few ways of customizing tmux and vim to help get
more done with less typing and context switching. Configuring tmux and vim to
get the exact behavior you want is often a time consuming endeavor, but in my
view it's worth it. Over the last few years of using tmux and vim together,
I've found a few tips and plugins that have really stood out. This post is a
collection of those essential tips that have become indispensable parts of my
development workflow.

If you're just getting started with tmux and vim, see the [related
reading](#related-reading) section for links to some resources to get you up to
speed.

### Moving Around

#### Seamless Navigation

As a general goal, I want to be able to use vim-style movements and text
editing patterns whether I'm in vim or some other tmux pane.

In vim, we use [splits](http://blogs.sourceallies.com/2009/11/vim-splits-an-introduction/) to divide up the current view,
allowing us to edit several files side by side, or even to edit multiple
regions of a single file without having to scroll around. Similarly,
tmux's [panes](https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read#panes) allow us to divide
up our window so we can run and view several terminal based commands and programs
at the same time.

I'm constantly using vim splits, so being able to move between splits
efficiently is crucial. By default, if you want to move from one split to another,
vim requires that you hit `ctrl-W` and then one of the directional keys (i.e. h, j, k, l).
This isn't as efficient as it could be, especially for such a common operation.

To address this, like many vim users, I edited my `.vimrc` to [simplify
split
navigation](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/vim-splits-move-faster-and-more-naturally#easier-split-navigations),
so that I can jump between vim splits using `ctrl-j`, `ctrl-k`, etc.
This is already a great efficiency win. With tmux in the picture, we can
use [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) to
not only set up these vim key bindings, but also to set up similar key bindings for
tmux pane navigation. This allows us to use `ctrl-<direction>`
to move anywhere in our tmux window, whether we're jumping between vim splits or
tmux panes.

#### Customizing Tmux Navigation Behavior

You may find yourself wanting to customize these navigation key bindings in
programs other than vim.

For example, recently I've been using the command line fuzzy finder
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) quite a lot. Out of the box, fzf
supports `ctrl-k` and `ctrl-j` for moving up and down its list of search
matches. Unfortunately, this won't work if you're using vim-tmux-navigator's
[suggested](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator#add-a-snippet)
key bindings in your `.tmux.conf`, which are as follows:

```bash
is_vim="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
    | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|n?vim?x?)(diff)?$'"

bind-key -n C-h if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-h"  "select-pane -L"
bind-key -n C-j if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-j"  "select-pane -D"
bind-key -n C-k if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-k"  "select-pane -U"
bind-key -n C-l if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-l"  "select-pane -R"
bind-key -n C-\ if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-\\" "select-pane -l"
```

This bit of configuration works by adding conditional logic to the
`ctrl-<direction>` key bindings.  When one of these movement commands is used,
it checks if the current tmux pane is running vim. If so, the appropriate vim
split navigation command is sent. Otherwise, the appropriate tmux pane
navigation command is sent.

Using a slightly different approach, we can add logic so that tmux will treat
fzf like it treats vim, sending fzf its own internal navigation commands rather
than tmux's pane navigation commands.

```bash
is_vim="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
  | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?g?(view|n?vim?x?)(diff)?$'"

is_fzf="ps -o state= -o comm= -t '#{pane_tty}' \
  | grep -iqE '^[^TXZ ]+ +(\\S+\\/)?fzf$'"

bind -n C-h run "($is_vim && tmux send-keys C-h) || \
                 tmux select-pane -L"

bind -n C-j run "($is_vim && tmux send-keys C-j)  || \
                 ($is_fzf && tmux send-keys C-j) || \
                 tmux select-pane -D"

bind -n C-k run "($is_vim && tmux send-keys C-k) || \
                 ($is_fzf && tmux send-keys C-k)  || \
                 tmux select-pane -U"

bind -n C-l run "($is_vim && tmux send-keys C-l) || \
                 tmux select-pane -R"

bind-key -n C-\ if-shell "$is_vim" "send-keys C-\\" "select-pane -l"
```

Using this general pattern in your `.tmux.conf`, you can further customize
vim-tmux-navigator's behavior to work nicely with any command line utilities
that use vim-style navigation.

The following demonstrates how you can move around vim splits, tmux panes, and
fzf results all using `ctrl-<direction>`.

![](/img/posts/tmux-vim-style-nav-with-fzf.gif)

It's worth noting that you don't need to do to this just to use
vim-tmux-navigator and fzf together. In addition to `ctrl-j` and `ctrl-k`, fzf
supports `ctrl-n` and `ctrl-p` for navigating search results. It even has a
`--bind` option for setting custom fzf key bindings. But, if you specifically
want to maximize the versatility of the `ctrl-j`, `ctrl-k`, etc. bindings
across several applications running in tmux, this pattern will help.

### A more vim-like shell

Tmux and bash both have support for vi modes, which can help make your shell
feel more like your editor. This is great because it means that when you move from
a vim pane to a shell pane, you don't have to do as big of a context switch.
Many of the same patterns for moving around and working with text can still apply.

You can use tmux's [vi
mode](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vi-mode-in-tmux/) to make tmux's copy
mode feel more like vim. In this mode you can use familiar vim commands to scroll,
search, select, and copy text.

Similarly, you can try bash's [vi
editing-mode](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-vi-editing-mode-cheat-sheet/).
Being able to use vi style movements and character matching commands to quickly
edit shell commands is really nice. Suddenly writing shell commands in bash and
lines of code in vim begin to feel a lot more similar. Also, if you find
yourself editing a complex shell command and you want to jump into vim for
real, just enter normal mode and hit `v`. This will drop you into vim, where
you can finish editing your command, writing this file will bring you back to
the shell and execute the command.

It's common practice for vim users to remap custom keys to escape, so we can [avoid
reaching](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key) so far every time we change from
insert to normal mode. For example, I'm using the sequence `kj` to bring me out of insert
mode. In order for bash's vi mode to feel comfortable, it's important to
be able to use your familiar mapping to go from insert to normal mode on the command line.

This can be configured in your `~/.inputrc` file. In my case, to make `kj` work,
I've added the following:

```bash
set editing-mode vi

# vi settings
$if mode=vi
  set keymap vi-insert
  "kj": vi-movement-mode # remap escape
$endif
```

### Simplify Vim Split and Tmux Pane creation

Splits and panes are both foundational concepts and should be really easy
to use. We've already covered standardizing the way we move between splits and panes,
but what about creating them in the first place?

I'm not a big fan of tmux's defaults for a working with panes for a few
reasons.  First, if you're already familiar with vim split terminology, the
words horizontal and vertical will mean the opposite of what you'd expect when
it comes to tmux panes. And second, the default commands (`<Prefix>%` and
`<Prefix>"`) for creating tmux splits never seemed intuitive to me.

I'm using on the following in my `.tmux.conf`:

```bash
bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind - split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

The beauty of this is that it allows you to continue thinking about splits and
panes in terms of the orientation of the divider, the same way you'd think
about a vim split. With these bindings, `<Prefix>|` adds a vertical pane
divider (like a vertical split in vim), and `<Prefix>-` adds a horizontal one.
If I remember correctly, I first saw these bindings recommended in the book
[Tmux: Productive Mouse-Free
Development](https://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux), which is full of great
tmux tips and really worth a read.

In vim, I primarily use vertical splits. So I've set the following in my `.vimrc`
which means that from normal mode, creating a new vertical split is as simple as
hitting `vv`.

```
" vv to generate new vertical split
nnoremap <silent> vv <C-w>v
```

Splits and panes are excellent features, so the most important thing is to find
key bindings that make them quick and intuitive for you to use.

### Quickly run shell commands without leaving Vim

Using what we've already covered, we now have the ability to quickly create
tmux panes and move between them, running commands where we wish. Easy as this
is, it's sometimes preferable to create a pane and run a command in it without
leaving vim at all.

I use [vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux) and its associated plugins to
run terminal commands from inside vim.

#### Vimux essential commands

One of the basic features of vimux is its ability to run an arbitrary shell
command from within vim. Once vimux is installed, you can access the command
prompt from within vim by running `:VimuxPromptCommand`. You can then
immediately start typing your shell command. Pressing enter will run the
command in a tmux pane in the current window. If necessary, vimux will create a
new pane for the command to run in.

Typing `:VimuxPromptCommand` every time you want to run a command isn't the best,
so it's recommended to add a mapping to your `.vimrc` like the following:

```
" Prompt for a command to run
map <Leader>vp :VimuxPromptCommand<CR>
```

Now, from normal mode you'll be able to type `<Leader>vp` to bring up the
prompt and issue commands, as shown here.

![](/img/posts/vimux-prompt-demo.gif)

That's already useful, especially for running tests, builds, or data processing
scripts. In many cases, especially for tests, you'll find yourself wanting to
run a shell command, make some code changes, and then run the shell command
again.

```
" Run last command executed by VimuxRunCommand
map <Leader>vl :VimuxRunLastCommand<CR>
```

Now, from normal mode `<Leader>vl` will rerun the most recent vimux command. This
really shines when it comes to running tests.

#### On running tests

Vimux is especially helpful when you have a failing test that you are trying to
fix. The workflow looks like this:

1. Locate the failing test, read it, and run it
2. Make changes to the application code to get the test passing
3. Rerun the last test (i.e. that last vimux command) using `<Leader>vl`
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the test passes

Using this workflow, it's possible to more efficiently get a failing test
passing, all without ever leaving vim. Quickly rerunning the last test command
is especially helpful.

When possible, consider using a vimux
[platform-specific-plugin](https://github.com/benmills/vimux#platform-specific-plugins).
These provide support for running the currently focused test in a test file,
running all the tests in the current file, etc.

#### Quickly copying vimux output

Let's say you want to scroll through or copy a bit of output from the vimux
pane. You could use `ctrl-<direction>` to move from vim to the vimux pane,
then you'd enter tmux's copy mode using `<Prefix>[`. That's a bit involved.
Fortunately, vimux offers a shortcut for this workflow.

Add the following to your `.vimrc`:

```
" Inspect runner pane
map <Leader>vi :VimuxInspectRunner<CR>
```

 Now `<Leader>vi` is all you need to jump from vim into the vimux pane, already in copy mode. From here, you can use [vi style movements](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/vi-mode-in-tmux/) as mentioned earlier, to move around, select text, and copy it to the clipboard.

#### Getting a better look at vimux output

Sometimes, especially when looking at test output on a laptop screen, it can be
a little cumbersome to read long lines in a small pane. There are all sorts of
ways you can efficiently resize your panes with tmux, but in this case, I've
found vimux's zoom feature to be a big help. If you haven't used zoom before,
it's a tmux feature that maximizes the active pane to fill the space of the entire tmux
window. When you're done zooming, you'll return to the previous pane arrangement
you had before. More info on tmux zoom can be found [here](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/zooming-tmux-panes/).
I've mapped <Leader>vz to the vimux command which will zoom in on the tmux runner pane.

```
" Zoom the tmux runner pane
<Leader>vz :VimuxZoomRunner<CR>
```

Now, you can run your tests with one vimux command, and if you need to, zoom in
on the results with `<Leader>vz`. Typically, at this point in order to leave
the zoomed mode, you'd have to use tmux's `<Prefix>z`, and that'll work just
fine. But, if you're using vim-tmux-navigator as mentioned above, you can also
use the `ctrl-<direction>` commands to exit the zoom mode as well.

### Going faster with chords

I use vimux commands a lot. So much so, that using leader-prefixed commands
like I've described above (e.g., `<Leader>vl`) began to feel inefficient. ~3
keystrokes is too much for an action that has become so central to my vim
workflow.

In practice, I've set up [vim chords](https://github.com/kana/vim-arpeggio) for
common use cases like running a single test, running all the tests in a file,
rerunning the last command etc. If you haven't given chords a try, I'd highly
recommend it. Anytime the leader key starts feeling more like a speed bump than a
shortcut, I start asking whether I should use a chord. Vim chords can be mapped
to whatever functionality you like, but personally I use them almost exclusively
for vimux bindings.

Here's a basic example, showing a simple workflow for a fixing a failing test.
This combines several of the elements discussed so far:

- The test is originally run using a chord mapped to [vimux-ruby's](https://github.com/pgr0ss/vimux-ruby-test) `RunRubyFocusedTest` test method. The chord is effectively a single keystroke.
- The vim split navigation is done using `ctrl-l`
- Subsequent test runs are done using another chord that reruns the last vimux
  command.

### Final thoughts

Over the last few years, tmux and vim together with these customizations and
practices, have formed the basis of a really enjoyable development environment
for me. This post covers just a few of the many possible ways to configure tmux
and vim to get even more out of both. The underlying principle here is about
seeking efficiency, specifically: when practical, we should reduce the
keystrokes and the cognitive load required to do common bits of work. Whether
you use vim and tmux or not, it's worth considering the intent behind these
tips as it applies to your own development tools. I hope you find the process
as fun as I have.
