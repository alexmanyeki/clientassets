Here's an update on the latest happenings in the Bugsnag San Francisco and Bath offices.

## Thank you to our UK summer intern, Graham Campbell!

This summer, we were fortunate to have one of the [most active open source developers](https://gist.github.com/paulmillr/2657075/) on Github, [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell), join us as a summer intern in Bugsnag’s Bath office.

Graham studies at the University of York and is the creator of [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/). He interned with us for 12 weeks, and even made it out to California during our company retreat in Lake Tahoe! Graham worked on our Open Source team, contributing massive overhauls to our PHP libraries and helping us expand and improve support for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/). We will miss you, Graham! Thanks so much for all your hard work this summer.
