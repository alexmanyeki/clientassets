We’re excited to bring you the 6th new feature of the *12 Features of Christmas*.

Today you’ll see some fantastic improvements to the events page. You can now jump to a specific time, making it easier to match log files and user reports to error activity in Bugsnag.

The live view on the events page let's you know what's happening in real time with your application. Now with our added functionality, you'll also be able to delve into the history of your application by looking back to a specific time.

Let us know what you think! Reach us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag).
