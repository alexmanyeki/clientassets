We’re pleased to announce the latest from the Bugsnag office: we now support [GitHub Enterprise](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/). You can seamlessly create tickets in GitHub Enterprise from within your Bugsnag dashboard. This means you’ll never have to switch between applications when you’re prioritizing bug fixing. We’re making your life that much simpler.

This combination is even more powerful if you’re using GitHub Enterprise and [Bugsnag Enterprise](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/) together. You can be confident you’re on top of problematic code, all without any data ever leaving your data centers.

We’d love to hear from you! Reach us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) or via [ email](mailto:hello@bugsnag.com) with questions.
