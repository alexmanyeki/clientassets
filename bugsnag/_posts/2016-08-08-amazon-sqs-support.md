[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/pricing/) now integrates with [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) allowing you to pipe your Bugsnag error data into business reports and other internal tools for your organization.

Amazon SQS is a message queue web service that allows you to store your organization's data until you're ready to process it. The queue is stored redundantly across servers so you're guaranteed availability. Integrating Bugsnag with SQS allows you to create accurate business intelligence reports to help your organization understand the impact of errors.
