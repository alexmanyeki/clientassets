With yesterday's release of our [dashboard redesign](/announcing-the-redesigned-bugsnag-dashboard) shipped, it's time to set our eyes on the upcoming holiday season. But we haven't busted out the eggnog or gone into hibernation just yet. Instead, over the next twelve days we're going to busy at work, releasing one new highly requested feature a day. We're calling it *Bugsnag's Twelve Features of Christmas*, and it begins today!


Feature one: Email Commands
---------------------------

Resolve, delete and create tickets in your issue tracker from within your email client using our brand new set of email commands. Add additional text to your replies to automatically create a comment on the error's details page.

The following commands are now supported:

-   **`@resolve`**<br>
    Mark the error as resolved

-   **`@delete`**<br>
    Delete the error

-   **`@issue`**<br>
    Create an issue for the error


We'd Love Your Feedback
-----------------------
Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new feature. We'd love to hear your feedback! Stay posted via our blog or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see what we release tomorrow!
