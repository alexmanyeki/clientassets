To make your apps better, you iterate often, releasing new versions to your customers regularly. After a while, errors in older app versions become less important as you work to maintain newer versions while continuing to build more features for your customers. In fact, you probably want to start ignoring errors from your oldest versions and focus your attention on the new.

Now you can discard errors by app version in Bugsnag, helping make your Dashboard clearer and more relevant to you.

You can set this up on your projects easily through our new [settings center](https://blog.bugsnag.com/new-bugsnag-settings/). Navigate to *Projects* in settings and select the project you'd like to configure. You'll find the option for *Discard by app version* under *Error Processing*.

You can specify version numbers in a few different ways â€” this feature supports [ranges](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#ranges), [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#Special_characters_meaning_in_regular_expressions), and wildcards. Once you've configured this option, Bugsnag won't notify you anymore about errors happening in the app versions you specified.
