Today we are pleased to announce the release of the official
[Bugsnag Python Notifier](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/python/).
The Bugsnag Python Notifier gives you instant notification of exceptions thrown
by your Django or Python app. The notifier will automatically notify your Bugsnag
project of any uncaught exceptions.


Django Support
---------------

The Bugsnag Python Notifier comes with full support for Django applications.
Using the Bugsnag Django middleware, you can see the full request, session and Django
environment that was affected by the exception. Integrating the notifier into your
Django application takes less than five minutes, so you can quickly start to realize
the benefits of using Bugsnag to track your errors.


Other Python Frameworks
-----------------------

We are planning to add deeper support for other major Python frameworks in the near
future, including Tornado and wsgi middleware so that we can bring official
Bugsnag support to more applications.
