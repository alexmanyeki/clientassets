Today we’re excited to announce another awesome feature for day 3 of the *12 Features of Christmas*! Starting today, you’ll see action buttons in the subject line of your Bugsnag notification emails in Gmail. If you’re using Gmail, you can click *View on Bugsnag* and navigate directly to the relevant error page in your dashboard.

This means you can jump straight to your new errors without even opening the email. How handy is that? This productivity feature saves you time dealing with bug-fixing and the hassle of email, so you can focus on the projects that matter most. We’ve got you covered!

Let us know what you think! Reach us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) with any feedback or questions.
