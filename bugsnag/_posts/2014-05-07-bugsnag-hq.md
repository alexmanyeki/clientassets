Many people have asked about us about our new office since we moved in last July, so here's some fun facts about Bugsnag HQ!

Our office is situated in downtown SF, just off [Market Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Street_(San_Francisco)). The historic 3-storey brick building was constructed in 1908 using reclaimed bricks from the [Great 1906 Earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake).

The building has beautiful high exposed ceilings and a hardwood floor, and since it is a corner office we're lucky enough to have a ton windows and natural light.

Our friend Abigail Stopper at [Abigail Design Studio](http://www.abigaildesignstudio.com/) did a fantastic job designing the space for us, coming up with an awesome floorplan, furniture and detail selections.

We're currently hiring for Engineering, Marketing and Sales roles, if you could see yourself working in an office like this or just want to swing by for a beer/cocktail, [fire us an email](mailto:james.smith@bugsnag.com)!
