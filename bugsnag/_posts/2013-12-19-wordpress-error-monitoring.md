We've only got a few days left on our *Twelve Features of Christmas*, but today we're excited to announce the release of our [WordPress Error Monitoring Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bugsnag/)!

</a>

All websites crash from time to time, including WordPress sites! The [WordPress Error Monitoring Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bugsnag/) automatically detects crashes, exceptions and other errors in your WordPress PHP code as well as errors in any plugins or themes you are using.

Errors are sent to your [Bugsnag Dashboard](https://www.bugsnag.com) for you to view and debug, and we'll also notify you by email, chat, sms or create a ticket in your issue tracking system if you use one. We'll also show you exactly how many times each error occurred, and how many users were impacted by each crash.


## We'd Love Your Feedback

Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new feature. We'd love to hear your feedback! Stay posted via our blog or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see what we release tomorrow!
