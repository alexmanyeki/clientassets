Lots is happening in the Bugsnag office these days, but most recently we got to welcome Martin Holman to our team! Martin is joining Bugsnag as a senior software engineer and will be leading our backend team.

Martin's been working as an engineer forever, but he recently spent some time as a ski instructor in Canada. He's originally from New Zealand, so we're excited to teach him all there is to know about California! He also loves coffee, craft beer, and board games (we're positive he's going to fit right in). To find our more about Martin, follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/martin308).
