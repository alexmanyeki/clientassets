Last week Square released an open source library for Ruby using the [Bugsnag API](https://docs.bugsnag.com/api/data-access/). They’ve named it Arthur, and you can check it out on GitHub [here](https://github.com/square/arthur).

So far they’ve built out the API for Bugsnag Projects and Errors, making it easier for Ruby developers to gain access to this information.

Shoutout to Square’s engineers for making the Bugsnag API even easier to use for Ruby developers. Kudos to them for contributing to the open source community! We love open source and even offer free Bugsnag to open source projects. Take a look [here](/bugsnag-loves-open-source).

Have you tried out Square’s new open source library for yourself? Let us know!
