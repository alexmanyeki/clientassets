The Bugsnag team will be kicking off our summer calendar with an action packed May. Here’s a roundup of where we’ll be in the next few months. We hope to see you there!

## RailsConf

We're thrilled to be sponsoring [RailsConf](http://railsconf.com/) again, and this year we'll be heading to Kansas City, Missouri from May 4th-6th. RailsConf is a three-day event boasting the largest gathering of Rails developers and Rubyists alike. Stop by our booth to pick up our new Bugsnag Rails lapel pin!

You can also come watch [James Smith's](https://twitter.com/loopj) talk, *Your Software is Broken-Pay Attention*, to learn about the future of production monitoring. He'll be speaking on Friday, May 6th, at 11:40am.

> Your team has been tasked with releasing new and better versions of your product at record speed. But the risk of moving quickly is things break in production and users abandon your buggy application. To stay competitive, you can't just ship fast - you also have to solve for quality.
In this talk, we'll rethink what it means to actively monitor your application in production so your team can ship fast with confidence. With the right tooling, workflow, and organizational structures, you don't have to sacrifice release times or stability. When things break, you'll be able to fix errors before they impact your users.

## OSCON

We'll be sponsoring [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us) for the very first time, and we're eager to see what the open source community has been up to! OSCON is dedicated to all things open source, and it will be taking place from May 17th through 19th in Austin, Texas.

## PyCon

From May 31st through June 1st, we'll be in Portland, Oregon for [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2016/)! Much like what RailsConf is for the Rails and Ruby communities, PyCon is the largest multi-day conference organized by the Python community for the community. We’re delighted to be returning and we'll be debuting our new Python lapel pins.

Finally, [Velocity](http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-ca) will bring us back to the Bay Area from June 22nd-23rd. The conference will take place in Santa Clara, CA and focuses primarily on web performance.
