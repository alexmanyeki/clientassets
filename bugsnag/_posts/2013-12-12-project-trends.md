It's now day three of our *Twelve Features of Christmas*, and we're exited to roll out one of our most frequently requested features. Starting right now, you'll see our new and improved project selector on your Bugsnag dashboard.

Clicking the project selector at the top-left of your dashboard now shows you a two-week trend chart. Project trends can help you decide which of your applications need attention and help you to better understand the current state of each of your Bugsnag projects. We also display the number of unresolved errors on each project, so you can see at a glance if everything is running smoothly.


We'd Love Your Feedback
