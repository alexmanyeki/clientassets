We believe error monitoring tools should work with you, helping you become a better developer who can avoid the coding mistakes that cause bugs. When errors occur, we also want to make the bug fixing process as painless as possible, giving you more time to focus on building new features for your customers.

When we first [launched Bugsnag in 2013](https://blog.bugsnag.com/announcing-the-redesigned-bugsnag-dashboard/), one of our main priorities was to give developers the answers they need to understand where production errors have occurred and how to fix them. Since then, we've focused on making it easier to understand the contextual data that helps you debug errors more efficiently. Today we're expanding Bugsnag's features, providing software development teams with even better tools for analyzing their error data, understanding the root cause of errors, and learning how to ship better code.

## Here's what's new

#### Improved filtering to explore your error data

This release introduces a new set of [universal filtering tools](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/filtering-dashboard/) that help you explore the error data generated by your application. This means you can answer questions about the connection between errors and your application's versions, release stages, hosts, deploys, and more. You can also specify time ranges, and combine multiple filters together, to better understand the severity of an error and whether it's worth spending your time to fix.

#### New data analysis tools for trend investigation

We've added a new Timeline page, which takes data mining and analysis in Bugsnag a step further. From this view, you can deeply investigate spikes in error rates, understand the impact of recently deployed code, and visually compare trends in your error data over time. Timeline graphs and Pivot Tables also give you the ability to test theories about the root cause of critical failures in your application.

#### More tools to triage and fix your errors

New workflow features give you more options to efficiently assess new errors as they come in, determine their impact, and decide what action to take against them.

The new Error Status Menu makes it easy to keep up to date on errors as they move from In Progress to Fixed. From a quick glance, you're able to see which errors have been triaged and which still need attention. This new workflow introduces Snooze and Ignore, so you have more control over your error notifications. You can Snooze errors until they meet certain custom criteria, like a spike in frequency over time, or Ignore errors indefinitely.

You can also stay informed on error status over time using the Activity Feed. For every error, you can see status changes to keep up on progress and what work has been done in comments from your team members.

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.bugsnag.com/product/) to explore how these features work more deeply and learn how you and your team can use them.

These features are all available to current Bugsnag customers the next time you log in, and if you aren't currently using Bugsnag, you can try us out by [signing up for a free 14-day trial](https://app.bugsnag.com/user/sign_in).

We are excited to share the most powerful and flexible version of Bugsnag yet, and to introduce new tools that will empower you and your team to tackle error monitoring in the best possible way. We hope you'll love it.
