Mobile crashes are often influenced by the state of your users' devices, for example lack of memory or disk space, and how long your app was running. As of right now, we'll help you answer these questions by showing you any patterns on the *Average Device State* area of error details pages on your Bugsnag dashboard.

Where possible, we've also backpopulated this breakdown using data we have already collected, so you might even see the results immediately! We also recommend upgrading your [iOS](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ios/) and [Android](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/android/) notifiers to ensure you can take advantage of all the great new features we've rolled out recently.

Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:support@bugsnag.com) to tell us what you think about the new feature. We'd love to hear your feedback! Stay posted via our blog or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bugsnag) to see what we release tomorrow!
